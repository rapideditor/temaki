An icon expansion pack for [Maki](https://github.com/mapbox/maki)

See https://rapideditor.github.io/temaki/docs for details about each icon.


### What is it?

The [Maki](https://github.com/mapbox/maki) icon pack is pretty great!  We use it in the [Rapid editor](https://github.com/facebook/rapid) and [name-suggestion-index](https://github.com/osmlab/name-suggestion-index) projects, but sometimes:

* We need an icon that's out of scope for Maki
* We don't want to wait for an icon to be added to Maki
* We're ok with not having 11px versions

So in these situations, we can just draw something "good enough" and put it here.  (Many of these icons also originally came from the [scottdejonge/map-icons repo](https://github.com/rapideditor/temaki/issues/2).)

The Temaki icons are a little bigger and messier than the Maki ones, but just as delicious. :yum:


### Design guidelines

We try to mostly follow the excellent [Maki design guidelines](https://www.mapbox.com/maki-icons/guidelines/) but these icons are only available in 15px versions.

The purpose of the temaki icons is:
- To look acceptable on 15px map pins
- To look really great on 40px preset labels

Some other guidelines:
- Try to snap coordinates to 1px pixel boundaries for maximum sharpness across all displays.
- 0.5px pixel boundaries will still look sharp on retina displays.
- Icons with anything shiny should be lit from the left (e.g. water, perfume, balloon).
- Try to be culturally neutral (e.g. avoid letters, numbers, left-to-right writing, currency symbols).
- Prefer solid dark shapes over stroked/outlined shapes.
- Prefer simplicity over complexity - fewer strokes, paths, control points.
- Prefer rounded corners and fun shapes (exceptions for serious things like weapons, security cameras).
- It's ok to break the rules.
